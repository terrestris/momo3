Agenda:
# `git` & GitHub quick run-through
  * `git` is a versioning system that is necessary if many people are working on the same resources, i. e. programming in the same files. It helps to keep track of changes in a meaningful way.
* Installation of `git` --> download started during the session; EIC administrators should install until next meeting
  * Note MJ: I thibnk what was downlaoded was [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) which probably includes `git`
* Configuration of git --> not explained during this session, briefly showed though
  * `git config user.name "Your Name"`
  * `git config user.email "email@domain.tld"`
  * `--global` flag (on shred computers probably impossible)
* Working with a local git repository --> MJ showed it in a very fast way; will repeat during next meeting 
  * `git status`
  * `git log`
  * `git add`
  * `git commit`
* Then github
  * on github --> during the session pull requests for the meeting-notes of 2015-11-25 were issued by participants from EIC and merged live by MJ using git and github
* Links to further tutorials via email --> information will be sent by e-mail but will also be added to this file
